# About Me

🙋‍♂️ Hi! My name is Kuni. Formerly a licensed physical therapist, I've recently transitioned towards a career in tech. I hold a doctorate in physical therapy, a bachelor's in biology, an associate's in exercise science, and just completed a bachelor's in computer science in February 2025. I initially started this transition through self-learning web development through the Odin Project, a free, open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. I immediately loved programming and took the plunge to pursue a bachelor's in computer science. 

### More
- 👨‍💻 I'm addicted to improving, learning, growing, and questioning, and I'm never quite satisfied.
- 🤝 Looking to connect with other developers, especially those on a similar journey as a career transitioner!
- 📈 I also love data and statistics and looking to create data-related projects for 2025.
- ⚡ Fun facts: other hobbies include philosophy, coffee, biology, psychology, travel, reading, video games, and exercise (former powerlifter and cross-fit competitor!), among other things.
