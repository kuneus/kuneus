# About Me

🙋‍♂️ Hi! My name is Kuni. I'm currently a licensed physical therapist practicing in the state of NJ in the US. I hold a doctorate in physical therapy, a bachelor's degree in biology, and an associate's degree in exercise science. What am I doing here then? Like many others in this enormous, vibrant community, I've recently caught the tech bug and looking to transition from PT to software engineering. I officially started this journey on January 1, 2023. Talk about bad timing, huh? Since then, while working full-time as a physical therapist, I've gone back to pursue my bachelor's of science in Computer Science at Western Governors University. I've also been self-learning web development through the Odin Project, a free, open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development.
