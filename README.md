# About Me

🙋‍♂️ Hi! My name is Kuni. I'm currently a licensed physical therapist practicing in the state of NJ in the US. I hold a doctorate in physical therapy, a bachelor's degree in biology, and an associate's degree in exercise science. What am I doing here then? Like many others in this enormous, vibrant community, I've recently caught the tech bug and looking to transition from PT to software engineering. I officially started this journey on January 1, 2023. Talk about bad timing, huh? Since then, while working full-time as a physical therapist, I've also been self-learning web development through the Odin Project, a free, open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development.

### More
- 📚 Soon to be pursuing another degree for a bachelor's in Computer Science at WGU starting in November 2023.
- 📈 I'm addicted to improving, learning, growing, and questioning, and I'm never quite satisfied.
- 🤝 Looking to connect with other developers, especially those on a similar journey as a career transitioner!
